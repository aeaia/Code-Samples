This hwk4 directory contains seven files, six of which I am submitting for grading (Card.java, Deck.java, 
Hand.java, Player.java, Game.java, and ReadMe).  Together they allow a computer user to simulate a game of 
poker. The other file (PokerTest.java) is for the grader's use only.

Comments:
  -- This project rather than the last one helped me understand object oriented programming.  I think I have 
     improved my program organization, but do still need work.
  -- Aces were a tricky problem that I dodged with if statements, but in a more perfect world, I would have
     preferred to create an ace that could be both higher and lower than other cards.
     
     
File Descriptions:

ReadMe:  This file.

Card.java:  Creates Card objects with suit and rank to imitate playing cards.  
Notes from the class description:
  -- This class creates objects with variables for suit and rank to imitate playing cards.  
  -- It is to be used by the Deck, Hand, and Game classes.
  -- Its methods include compareTo (compares cards to each other) and toString (names cards with words).


Deck.java:  Makes a deck of Card objects.  
Notes from the class description:
  -- This class makes a deck of Card objects.
  -- I have included the methods shuffle, swap, and draw to control the deck.
  -- I have also included a method for the grader (or a later user) to print the cards in the deck and make
     sure they have the desired attributes.  This method (deckCheck) is not used by the project.  

Hand.java:  Creates an object with an array of cards.
Notes from the class description:
  -- The Hand class creates an object with an array of cards and three instance variables for ease of hand
     evaluation.
  -- It also includes methods for changing which Card objects are in the Hand.
  -- There are methods to sort the hand by rank of the cards (and methods that allow this to happen), fill the 
     array in the hand with cards, and determine how the hand would be scored.  
  -- Note: the sort method that has been block commented out of use was less neat than the used method, so I
     blocked it out but left it in case it could be useful later.  I don't want it to be graded.

Player.java:  Creates the object that implements and controls the hand and the deck 
Notes from the class description:
  -- This class creates the Player object that controls the hand and the deck.  
  -- Methods include dealing the cards and redrawing.  It does what a person would do.


Game.java:  Runs the poker simulation.
Notes from the class description:
  -- The game class runs the poker simulation.  It creates a player and directs the program user to play.  

PokerTest.java:  Utility for grader.
Notes from the class description:
  -- This class is for the grader.  Sorry if it's messed up or just not helpful.  Instructions on how to use 
     it are in the text.
